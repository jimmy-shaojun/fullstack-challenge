# Full-stack Engineer Written Challenge

## 1. Monitoring and testing

Assume you are working on a web app with an open API. You are implementing site monitor and regular tests to discover security vulnerabilities and identify performance bottlenecks. What approaches will you take, and what tools will you use?

You can craft your answer regarding a general situation, but you can also refer to the products at Matter Lab:

- Matters.Town: a web application where users can log in with Ethereum wallet, discover content, publish content on the IPFS network, donate ERC20 tokens to each other, etc.
- Matters server: a [GraphQL server](https://server.matters.town/playground) that analyzes content, pins data on IPFS, and listens to events on blockchains. It is used by Matters.Town and other 3rd party applications.

## 2. Architecture & scalability

The architecture diagram of Matters.Town can be found [here](https://github.com/thematters/developer-resource). Given such architecture, as Matters.Town scale to more users, where do you think the bottleneck will be? How will you change the architecture as Matters.Town scale 10 folds? What about 100 folds?

## 3. Personal interest

Please tell us about a project you are currently working on or learning about. Why do you find it interesting, and what is the most effective way for you to work on it or learn about it?
